# Hi there, I'm Diana 👋

I'm a frontend developer with a love for playful interfaces, eerie aesthetics, and the occasional prank. I build things that are both functional and fun.

I’m currently deepening my knowledge of JavaScript and React, building real-world projects, and exploring how user experience can be weird, clever, or even a little unsettling.

## 🔧 What I work with

- **Frontend:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Bootstrap, EJS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Extras:** Git, Figma, Windows Desktop (WPF), Markdown, basic APIs
- **Current goal:** Integrating databases and polishing my first browser extension!

## ✨ Highlight Projects

🔍 **[Food Allergens Browser Extension](https://github.com/roukorjerte/foodExtension)**  
A browser extension that scans online grocery stores for hidden allergens using OpenAI and Open Food Facts. Built for real-world use, focused on accessibility and UX. (WIP)

🎭 **[Password Game — Corporate HR Edition](https://github.com/roukorjerte/1stApril28stone)**  
A satirical login page turned into a chaotic password challenge. Disguised as a corporate internal tool to prank coworkers — built with React, animated rules, and a scoreboard.

🖥️ **[Tiny Browser Workspace](https://github.com/roukorjerte/My-Tiny-Workspace)**  
A fake desktop environment in the browser. Drag windows, use the calculator, open a fake chat — all wrapped in a cute UI.

📝 **[Personal Blog Platform](https://github.com/roukorjerte/blogApp)**  
A clean, responsive blog with a simple CMS. Create, delete, and edit posts, upload images, and filter content. Built with Node.js, Express, EJS, and Bootstrap.

🐾 **[Desktop Tamagotchi](https://github.com/roukorjerte/Tamagochi)**  
A little virtual pet in a desktop app, built in C# with WPF. Has needs, expressions, sounds, and a cozy UI. I’m proud of this one — I saw it through to the end.

## 🧠 A few things about me

- I learn fast, especially when I'm excited about something weird.
- I enjoy building things that make people smile — or raise an eyebrow.
- I used to work in QA, so I know how to break stuff *and* fix it.
- I like bold visuals, surreal atmospheres, and passionate about horror stories.
